# nekos.py-api-downloader

This is a small piece of code I made for fun. It uses the nekos.py api(https://github.com/Nekos-life/nekos.py) and download images from the img function. The actual api is needed for the code to work.

Feel free to spin off this code because I don't really care about it. If anyone figures out how to make it so that the code can be shut down by the user, please tell me.

The code is only 1 file(main.py). The other 2 files are just so that it can store the downloaded links and the banned links(the ones that cause errors) so that it won't repeat links or errors.

***NOTE:*** While the code may be small, it can do a lot. It uses a forever while loop in the code so it can download a lot of files. The nekos.py api is not small. It has at least 22k images in the IMG FUNCTION ALONE. Make sure u have a lot of space. From my experience, you need about 20***GB*** of space.
